# react-native-authentication-services
React Native iOS components for authenticating with Google, Facebook, and Twitter via Oauth

Each component consists of a service component along with a React Native button that can be used to trigger the service.

You will need to edit the default properties of each service and add your credentials for sign-in.

Additionally, because this is using Oauth through a SFSafariViewController, you will need to link the react-native-safari-view component with your iOS project.
